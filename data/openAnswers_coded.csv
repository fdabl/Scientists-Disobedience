R_5j2OullUeJ9FGHP,"Climate change is a ridiculous notion perpetrated on the ignorant masses in order to enrich politicians and their cronies. This media report gives a ludicrous account of what ""scientists"" say will happen if we don't explore new sources of energy. Where is the opposing viewpoint that no harm comes from drilling oil and gas?",1,,2
R_72MtmreHAdNgAsx,media portrayed the protest as peaceful and well done.,1,,
R_7AGUJt8dgTJ8dCf,Climate activest blocked the federal reserve because they don't want anymore new drilling. Scientist agree with activist because they are being ignored,1,,1

R_6pmoCgafLe1aTim,"At first the article seemed neutral, but on a little closer inspection, it is one-sided.

R_11oYXjHIisDR6EU,"The media portrays the protest in a pretty positive light, stating that this was peaceful protesting with no one really disrupted from the protest (which is probably untrue). It seems to portray the protestors in a logical manner while placing the blame on the government",1,,

R_1Uc5HlVHt8pGPIt,I believe the media reported this as unbiased as they could have. The seemed to have stuck to the facts but did not report whether they think climate change is happening.,1,,
R_33fl15RgYyelayG,This is a example of a dignified protest. When people march and protest with dignity and civilization as in organized formations that allows large gatherings that draws peoples attention without clashes or unnecessary behaviors such as eco warriors or such as the captiol hill riot.,1,,
R_1ZB7kCaksjofBOV,They portrayed the protest quite well it talks about it being peaceful. Simple and the scientist who normally do not back it do and we are given a good reason as to why.,1,,1

The coverage highlighted the urgency of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius as advised by scientists and the International Energy Agency.",1,,2
R_67PWDrgfLs86INX,This seems non-biased. It also seems a little confusing for people without a understanding of climate change.,1,,
R_5c7Nzg0gRNcQ9BT,They took accounts from people in support of mitigating climate change. There was no comments from companies who are supporting drilling for oil and gas.,1,,
R_1TSnt6PvLZHe10u,They explore the protestors' perspective by offering support from scientists like Dr. Alex Fraser. It's interesting that no one from the Federal Reserve is interviewed to share their perspective.,1,,1
R_6rI0RnbLkLIVexj,It felt like a neutral representation of what happened. They explained what happened and an endorsement of what happened from an involved party.,1,,

R_6GP6xnUaA6lnZyr,"The protest was shown to be peaceful but it did not go into detail about how they were blocking entrances. The fact that over 100 protesters were arrested leaves it open for someone to think that they were not ""mostly peaceful"".",1,,

R_12GrP1XYwKmb6St,In this article it feels mostly factual. They didn't get into the validity of the protest just where it happened and that it was ahead of UN Meetings that were taking place. The writer mentioned the concerns scientists have about the climate and quoted a scientist who was part of the protest. As articles go I felt they were pretty neutral in presenting the information.,1,,2
